# Terminal Application 

### **Overview**
I have created a 'madlibs' style game that contains a menu showing three different stories to choose from. The user will select the story they'd like to play and it will ask some questions. Once the user input has been collected, the words will be inserted into the story and it will print on the screen. There will be an option to go back to the menu so the game can be played again.
